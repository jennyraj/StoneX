This time around, the company is helmed by real estate veteran Sandeep Mathrani , and has majorly slimmed down operating expenses. As a result, it''s touting to investors that by the fourth quarter of this year, the company will be EBITDA profitable, a financial indicator of a company''s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Of course, EBITDA-profitability is not the same as total profitability, especially for a company that has over $4 billion in total debt. The company paid $532 million in interest and other income expenses in 2020, expenses that are removed from an EBITDA calculation. The company did not include any non-adjusted figures that would show profitability with expenses like depreciation and interest included.",
